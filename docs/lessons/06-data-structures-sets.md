# 05 - Data Structures: Sets

**Leading teacher:** Maciej

## Goals

- learn what are sets and math theory behind it
- learn when sets can be used
- how sets are different from the lists
- get familiar with two implementations coming in JDK: `HashSet`, `TreeSet`
- get familiar with the most commonly used methods on sets

## Slides

**TBD**

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Write a static method `intersection` that will return an intersection of two sets given by parameters. **Note** - sets given by parameters may not be modified.

```java

Set<String> intersection(Set<String> x, Set<String> y) {
    ...
}
```
### Exercise 2

Write a static method `union` that will return an union of two sets given by parameters. **Note** - sets given by parameters may not be modified.

```java

Set<String> union(Set<String> x, Set<String> y) {
    ...
}
```

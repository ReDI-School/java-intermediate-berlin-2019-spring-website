### Excercise 1
Create 2 robots named Rob and Bot. Rob is yellow and Bot is blue. Rob weights 10kg while Bot just 8kg. Rob has green eyes and Bot has black eyes. 
Each of the robots should print their attributes when asked to introduce themselves.
Create a class that has all the attributes that Rob and Bot have and a method called `introduce()` that will let the robots tell us all their characteristics, then create Rob and Bot and ask them to introduce themselves.

Example: *My name is Rob. I weight 10kg. I have green eyes.*

## Homework
1. Implement a Java program that interleaves 2 lists in a third list.
For example, given listA = {1,2,3} and listB={4,5,6}, listC should be listC={1,4,2,5,3,6}

2. Given a list, print in the console the sorted list. Then, reverse the list and print it to the console.

Example:  given the following list
list = {5, 2, 10, 6, 8, 3}

The sorted list will be:
sotedList = {2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10}

The reversed list will be:
reveresedList = {10, 8, 6, 5, 3, 2}

**Advanced**

If you did OOP before, you can try to do some exercises with an actual implementation of the list.
